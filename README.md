# HackerRankTests
learning through hacker rank, leet code and my technical interview test

Objective is to not push the hardest but make my brain used to algorithm question. 
Often times, it took me more than 1 hour to solve some simple question disguiesd in a story.
So I want to reduce the time that I spent understanding the problem and testing the code itself.
